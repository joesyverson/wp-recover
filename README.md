# wp-recover

Clone a remote Wordpress and use for local staging environment.

## Background

Some very nice friends of mine have a Wordpress deployed through a cloud provider.

The object of this project is to backup that Wordpress instance with all of its data and use it to create a local staging environment.

This will allow my friends to stage changes and upgrades, and give them more freedom to change providers if they choose.

I may end up incorporating this procedure into other projects.
